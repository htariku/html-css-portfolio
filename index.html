          </h2>
          <p>
            My Name is Helen Tariku, I am 23 years old and a recent grad from Virginia Commonwelath University. I am currently working at Virginia Hospital Center as a certified Medical Labratory Technologist in their Microbiolog, Hematology, and Chemistry department. I basically analyze and run tests for various specimens and body fluids to see if there are any abnormalitie. Alongside that, I also run covid PCR testing with te newly emerged and ongoing pandemic taking place right now. 
            <br/>
            During my time as a Lab tech I have found a great intrest in instrumentation and grew more curious of the roles that our enigenears and information technologists played. I have enrolled in George Washington Coding Bootcamp to expand my learning, espicially as the world of technology is constantly growing (even in healthcare). With my new found skill I hope to contrubute my creativity and ideas to the feild and craft my skills overtime.
